## 👋 DrimTech is an IT-focused club at a high school from Shanghai, China.

👀 DrimTech was established with the purpose of popularizing information technology, promoting the development of the IT community, and covering everything related to computers.

🌱 On August 31, 2024, DrimTech transitioned into an actual club, offering offline classes during the Friday extension course and starting online public club classes every Friday at 20:00 under the "teach others as capable" policy. These classes are open to everyone and taught by capable students in the club on their areas of expertise.

💞️ The club has an AI virtual character named CAte.

😄 Welcome to join DrimTech if you are interested in IT!
